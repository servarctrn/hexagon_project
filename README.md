The algorithm developed by Dijkstra maintains a priority queue to systematically select the vertex with the smallest known distance from the source and updates the distances of its neighboring vertices accordingly. This process continues until the shortest paths to all vertices are determined.
ðŸ§  Purpose of the Script
The script implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two cities based on a CSV dataset. It does the following:

Reads the graph data from a file

Builds a graph of cities and distances

Accepts user input for source and destination cities

Validates input

Computes and displays the shortest path and its distance

Visually draws the graph highlighting the path
